# ML1819--task-101--team-23
Comparative study of the performance of linear and logistic regression, and neural networks deployed in Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn and AzureML. Completed for the module Machine Learning at Trinity College Dublin.

Full paper can be found at 'Paper.pdf' file.

## Conclusions
Results show that Scikit-learn and AzureML tend to give better results in terms of accuracy and precision for the three algorithms. Tensorflow has a better results in terms of the recall, all these being for the classification algorithms.

For the regression algorithm, both scikit-learn and AzureML give better results in the evaluation metrics used (MAE and RMSE)
